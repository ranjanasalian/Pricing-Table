# Pricing-Table
This is small project, where i built a pricing table using flex box in CSS. It's usually of three categories - small, medium, large, and it shows the customers which features they'll  get based on which tier they're going to subscribe to.  This is pretty much what i have build, although in a little bit simpler way.
